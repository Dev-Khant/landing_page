<p style="text-align: center;">You can try vector search on Qdrant Cloud in three steps. 
</br> Instructions are below, but the video is faster:</p>

## Setup a Qdrant Cloud cluster

1. Register for a [Cloud account](https://cloud.qdrant.io/) with your email, Google or Github credentials.
2. Go to **Overview** and follow the onboarding intructions under **Create First Cluster**. 
3. When you create it, you will receive an API key. Copy it and prepare to paste it soon.
4. Your new cluster will be created under **Clusters**. Give it a few moments to provision.

## Access the cluster dashboard

1. Go to your **Active Clusters**. Under **Actions**, open the **Dashboard**.
2. Paste your new API key here. If you lost it, make another in **Access Management**.
3. The key will grant you cluster access. Now you can see the cluster Dashboard.

## Try the Tutorial sandbox

1. Open the interactive **Tutorial**. Here, you can test basic Qdrant API requests.
2. Using the in-tutorial instructions, create a collection, add vectors and run a search.
3. The output on the right will show you some basic semantic search results.

## Done
That's vector search! You can stay in the sandbox and continue trying our different API calls.</br>
When you're ready, use the Console and our complete REST API to try other operations.
